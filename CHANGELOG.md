# 1.1 (2015-09-20)
- Better and more specific error messages. Some people had the generic "Invalid API key" even if that wasn't the cause of the problem. Also, depending on the error, the application won't necessary stop.
- When you stop the application, you have now two options. You can start over (resets the graph and all the acquired and lost items) or resume.
- A new section "Other currencies" is now available. All the currencies of the wallet are now tracked as well.
- The application will now check automatically if a new version is available. If so, a popup will inform the user.
